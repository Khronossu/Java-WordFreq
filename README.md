DE113 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (2/66) Final Java Project
  The project is about "Search Engine (Word-Document Matrix Construction)" 

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a Java program that can read through a collection of text files,
process the contained text, and construct a word-document matrix that represents the frequency of
each word in each document. This matrix can be used for various text analysis tasks, such as
document similarity checks, information retrieval, and data mining.
